- unzip the file

### to use in Chrome
- search `chrome://extensions/` in your Chrome search bar
- toggle on the "Developer mode" button at the top right of the page
- click the "Load unpacked" button at the top left of the page
- double-click the "web-extensions" folder and then double-click the folder of the extension you want to use and click "Select"
- in chrome, click the puzzle piece button at the top right of the browser, and click the pin button next to the extension so you can easily click on the extension later
- now, when you click on the extension icon in your toolbar, you can use the extension!
